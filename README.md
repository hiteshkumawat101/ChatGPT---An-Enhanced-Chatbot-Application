## Overview

ChatGPT+ is an AI-powered chatbot that has been built upon OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It aims to enhance the user experience by incorporating new features like the ability to answer questions in the context of previous questions and responding to voice-based queries with both voice and text responses.

## Features

The application processes the voice input, generates a response, and can also provide the answer in both voice and text formats, offering a seamless voice-based interaction.

3. **Enhanced Natural Language Understanding**: With the power of GPT-3.5, ChatGPT+ boasts an improved understanding of natural language. It can comprehend complex queries, colloquial language, and even handle some language-specific nuances.

4. **Interactive Conversations**: Engage in interactive and dynamic conversations with ChatGPT+. The chatbot can maintain continuity and context, leading to more natural and human-like interactions.

5. **Customization Options**: Fine-tune the behavior of ChatGPT+ to align with your specific use cases. Adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens to control the creativity and length of responses.
